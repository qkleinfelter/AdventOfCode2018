# AdventOfCode 2018
This repository contains my (Quinn Kleinfelter's) solutions for the challenges of Advent Of Code 2018, running December 1st, through the 25th.
The challenges can be found at [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

For your convenience and mine, each Day is contained within its own package and I will include both the input I receive from AoC
and my solved answers along with the code.

Most days I will probably do in Java, however I may also occasionally complete a challenge in Javascript, Python, or C# as well.

I highly encourage you to try these challenges on your own as well if you are interested in programming as they are a great way to learn a lot.

Merry Christmas and Happy Coding!

-Quinn
